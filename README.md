Project Title:
Tracking Paths in Polynomial Time – Implementation of Graph Algorithms

Overview
This project implements algorithms from the paper "Tracking Paths in Polynomial Time", which explores solutions to the Tracking Paths Problem—determining a minimal set of vertices (or edges) that uniquely track all s → t paths in a given graph. The problem is NP-hard in general, but the paper presents polynomial-time algorithms for chordal graphs, tournament graphs, and bounded-degree graphs.
